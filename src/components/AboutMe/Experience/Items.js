        content: 'I had the opportunity to work under the Human Resources Business Information Services (HRBIS) department and the Business Administrative, Policy, Projects and Resources (BAPPR) department at UC Santa Cruz. I led and trained a team of students on a project to update the web pages on the staff human resource website by reviewing content, understanding policies, and communicating with subject matter experts to ensure that pages were up to date. We also used the campus Web Content Management System (WCMS) to edit and process updates to our web pages, reviewed the HTML source codes to ensure consistency in styling, and examined ways to improve accessibility, such as implementing analyzing site navigation. Due to remote work conditions, I implemented a project management tool to keep track of the team\'s tasks and progresses on various web pages. We were able to update more than 60% of the entire HR website and resolved over 50 web support tickets through the Information Technology Services Request Ticketing System, tackling problems, such as tracking the source of broken links then locating the correct links, and removing duplicate web contents. Aside from the web update project, I also automated some processes for generating reports with data from several Excel workbooks by writing Python scripts. Through this experience, I learned the responsibilities of being a project leader, implemented solutions to uprising problems, worked with teams and leaders in a professional setting, and utilized different resources to solve problems.'

I was mainly responsible for coordinating with multiple parties from 6 different time zones to schedule and set up interviews between the candidate and the internal interview teams via Google Calendar and Zoom. In order to keep candidates from different roles organized, I implemented my own candidate management tool to keep track of candidates\' interview stages and dates, which increased my efficiency by at least 25%. Aside from scheduling interviews, I also had the chance to assist different teams in projects such as data transition from Excel to a cloud-based management software, as well as tracking and managing essential files via Box and Google Drive. With this experience, I discovered and experimented different ways to keep organized and practiced to be detail oriented. I had demonstrated my abilities to juggle multiple tasks and projects as I was also pursuing my degree and working in another part-time role at UC Santa Cruz while keeping up with the responsibilities of this role.'
