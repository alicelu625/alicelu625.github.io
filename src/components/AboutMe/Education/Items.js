        content: 'At UC Santa Cruz, I developed foundational skills in computer science such as data structures, algorithms, and computer systems design. Among the elective courses I took (mobile application development, web development, database systems, etc.), I discovered my passion for web development, which gave me the push to begin pursuing a career in front-end/full stack web development and developing more skills post-college.'

        course: 'Responsive Web Design',
        content: 'College only gave me the basics in web development, so I took the initiative to find free online resources to expand my knowledge and skills. I discovered freeCodeCamp and began their Responsive Web Design Certification coursework, where I learned about HTML, CSS (including Flexbox and Grid), visual design, accessibility, and principles of responsive web design.'

        course: 'React - The Complete Guide',
        content: 'I had discovered that React is a very popular JavaScript library that is listed as a qualification for my role. Since I’ve never used React nor know how to use it, I enrolled myself in Udemy’s React course, where I learned about React through follow along coding practices and hands-on projects. Along with the course, I’ve put my newly learned skills to practice by building personal projects, such as this website.'
